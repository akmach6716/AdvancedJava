Interview Questions from my last 2Interviews Experience Feb and March 2025

1) Write a program to test a RESTful API. The program should be able to handle authentication, make GET and POST requests, and validate the responses.
2) How would you design a test case in Java for a system that requires multiple steps, where each step's output is the next step's input?
3) Demonstrate how to mock external dependencies (e.g., databases) in a test case . Provide an example
4) Given an array arr[] and positive integer k, the task is to count the total number of pairs in the array whose sum is divisible by k. Input: arr[] = {5, 9, 36, 74, 52, 31, 42}, k = 3 Output: 7 Explanation: There are seven pairs whose sum is divisible by 3, i.e, (9, 36), (9,42), (74, 52), (36, 42), (74, 31), (31, 5) and (5, 52).
5) Given an integer array nums, move all zero elements to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Modify the array in place with O(1) extra space. Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12] Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
6) How do you handle a blocker in testing, and what strategies can help overcome it?
7) What strategy do you follow when starting a new project to ensure effective test coverage?
8) . What is the shift-left approach in testing, and can you provide a real-time scenario where it was beneficial?
9) Have you encountered any bugs while implementing the shift-left approach, and how did you handle them?
10) Given an array of integers, return all elements that appear at least twice, in the order they first became duplicates.

SDET Coding Problems before your next interview

1) Two Sum problem
2) Running sum of an array
3) Remove duplicates from a sorted array
4) Remove Element from an array
5) Search Insert Position
6) Two String Anagram
7) Remove duplicates from a String: Return without duplicates
8) Print the words of a string in reverse
9) Moving all zeroes to end
10) Reverse every subarray formed by consecutive K elements

Note: Following the best practices and best time complexity are the real challenges during interviews.

Note: If you know different programming approaches can be a added advantage!

Note: Two pointer, sorting and searching algorithms are crucial
